# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_System_using_Neural_Network

**Breast Cancer Tumor Prediction System**
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using a Neural Network model. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, available in the sklearn library. The application processes features of the tumor and returns a classification with high accuracy.


**Project Overview**
Model Type: Neural Network (NN)

Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

Accuracy: 93%


**Key Features**
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, and features are standardized for optimal model performance.

Model Architecture: A multi-layer neural network was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

Training and Evaluation: The model was trained on 70% of the data and evaluated on 30% of the data, achieving a 93% accuracy in predicting malignant and benign tumors.

Deployment: This model can be deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
Libraries and Tools Used

Python: Core programming language

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: Numerical computations

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization

TensorFlow/Keras: Neural network implementation

scikit-learn: Data preprocessing, train/test splitting

Streamlit: Deployment of the web application


**Model Performance**


Accuracy: 93%

Precision and Recall: High performance across classification tasks, evaluated using a confusion matrix and other metrics.


**Future Enhancements**


Hyperparameter Tuning: Improve performance through more rigorous hyperparameter optimization.

Deployment on Cloud: Deploy the application on platforms like Heroku or AWS for wider access.
